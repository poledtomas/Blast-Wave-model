# Blast-Wave-model
Heavy-ion collisions are complex, and there are several different models trying to explain one or more features. One of these models is the blast-wave model, which describes the dynamics of the freeze-out phase. The main idea of the blast-wave model is that the hadrons suddenly decouple simultaneously, i.e. the freeze-out happens at the same time. This results in a transverse two-dimensional (2D) hydro parametrization blast-wave that boosts the particles created in the collision. The hadrons get boosted according to their mass via the local flow velocity
